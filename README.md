<p>Getting banned from Valorant can feel like getting hit by a surprise spike rush — sudden and crushing! If you think your ban was a big oopsie, don’t panic.

<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Got banned the moment you made a new account? Or does the ban dog you no matter which account you use? Chances are, you’re <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! Valorant’s anti-cheat is pretty serious and may have flagged your PC hardware, blocking you from playing even after wiping accounts.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-understand-why-you-were-banned-">Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓</h2>
<p>Check your emails or Valorant notifications carefully to see why Riot slapped the ban hammer on you. Usual ban suspects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheating or running shady third-party programs  </li>
<li>Toxic behavior, flaming, or harassment  </li>
<li>Account sharing or unusual suspicious activity  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Before sending off that appeal, skim through Riot’s Terms of Service to know what you’re up against.</p>
