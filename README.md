# How to Get Unbanned on Valorant (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Valorant can feel like getting hit by a surprise spike rush — sudden and crushing! If you think your ban was a big oopsie, don’t panic. This handy guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal like a pro to hopefully get back to your ranked grind.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Got banned the moment you made a new account? Or does the ban dog you no matter which account you use? Chances are, you’re **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Valorant’s anti-cheat is pretty serious and may have flagged your PC hardware, blocking you from playing even after wiping accounts.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your emails or Valorant notifications carefully to see why Riot slapped the ban hammer on you. Usual ban suspects include:
- Cheating or running shady third-party programs  
- Toxic behavior, flaming, or harassment  
- Account sharing or unusual suspicious activity  

**Pro-tip:** Before sending off that appeal, skim through Riot’s Terms of Service to know what you’re up against.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

Before you hit up Riot Support, have these ready:
- Your Riot account email address  
- Your Valorant username/handle  
- The exact date you got banned  
- Any screenshots or error messages you got
